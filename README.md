##🧠 CODTECH Internship Task 4 – Data Compression Tool (RLE)
For Task 4 of the CODTECH internship, I developed a Data Compression Tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm. This tool is implemented in the C programming language and executed using the OnlineGDB compiler — a free, web-based IDE that supports multiple programming languages and enables easy testing and debugging of code. 🌐💻

🛠️ Tool Used – OnlineGDB
OnlineGDB is an online compiler and debugger which I used to write, compile, run, and test my C code. It provides:

A clean and user-friendly interface.

A virtual terminal for I/O interactions.

Support for debugging with breakpoints and step execution.

Ability to save and share code through URLs. 📎

This made it convenient to develop and test the RLE tool without needing to install any software locally. It's especially useful for quick collaboration and remote learning environments. 🎓

🔍 How the Tool Works
The RLE compression tool allows a user to:

Compress a text file by replacing sequences of the same character with a count and the character.

Decompress a previously compressed file by expanding the counts back into repeated characters.

💡 Example:

Original Text: aaabbbccc

Compressed: 3a3b3c

Decompressed: aaabbbccc

The tool takes input and output filenames from the user and performs the selected operation. It also includes error handling for cases like empty files or invalid file paths.

🌍 Applications of RLE Compression
Run-Length Encoding is a simple and effective compression method, especially for data that contains many repeated values. This project has several real-world applications:

🖼️ 1. Image Compression
RLE is widely used in bitmap image formats like BMP or TIFF, especially in monochrome or limited-color images where many pixels are the same. It reduces file size without losing quality.

📜 2. Document Storage
For large plain-text documents or logs with repeated characters (like spaces or special formatting), RLE can help reduce storage size.

🖨️ 3. Fax Machines
Older technologies like fax machines often use RLE to compress data before transmitting, saving bandwidth.

📶 4. Data Transmission
In embedded systems and data communication protocols, RLE helps reduce data size for faster and more efficient transmission.

📂 5. Learning Projects
RLE is often one of the first compression techniques taught in computer science, making this project a great beginner’s exercise in file handling and algorithms.

✅ Why This Project Is Valuable
💾 It shows how basic compression can reduce storage usage.

🧩 Helps in understanding pattern recognition and string manipulation.

💡 Strengthens C programming skills, especially in file I/O and loops.

📈 Can be extended into more advanced compression techniques later (like Huffman Coding).

🏁 Conclusion
This RLE Data Compression Tool, built using the OnlineGDB compiler, is a practical and educational project that demonstrates how compression algorithms work. It's applicable in real-world scenarios where storage efficiency matters and serves as a stepping stone into more complex data processing techniques.

Feel free to try it out yourself and explore the world of compression! 🚀📚
